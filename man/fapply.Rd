\title{Apply formatting to a vector}
\usage{
fapply(x, format = NULL, width = NULL, justify = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A vector, factor, or list to apply the format to.}

\item{format}{A format to be applied.}

\item{width}{The desired character width of the formatted vector.  Default
value is NULL, meaning the vector will be variable width.}

\item{justify}{Whether to justify the return vector.  Valid values are 
'left', 'right', 'center', 'centre', or 'none'.}
}
\value{
A vector of formatted values.
}
\description{
The \code{fapply} function applies formatting to a vector.
}
\details{
The \code{fapply} function accepts several types of formats:  formatting
strings, named vectors,
vectorized functions, or user-defined formats.  It also 
accepts a formatting list, composed of any of the previous types.  
The function will first determine the type of format, and then apply 
the format in the appropriate way.  Results are returned as a vector.

The function also has parameters for width and justification.

Parameters may also be passed as attributes on the vector.  See 
the \code{\link{fattr}} function for additional information on setting
formatting attributes.
}
\section{Types of Formats}{

The \code{fapply} function will process any of the following types of
formats:
\itemize{
  \item{\strong{Formatting string:} A single string will be interpreted as 
a formatting string.  See the \link{FormattingStrings} documentation for 
further details.}
  \item{\strong{Named vector:} A named vector can serve as a lookup list or 
  decode 
for a vector.  You can use a named vector to perform simple 
lookups on character vectors.}
  \item{\strong{Format object:} A format object may be created using the 
\code{\link{value}} function.  The format object is included in the 
\strong{fmtr} package, and is specially designed for data categorization.}  
  \item{\strong{Vectorized formatting function:} A vectorized function 
  provides
the most flexibility and power over your formatting.  You can use 
an existing formatting function from any package, or create 
your own vectorized formatting function using \code{\link[base]{Vectorize}}.}
\item{\strong{"best" format name:} A "best" format name of the form 
"bestW", where "W" is the desired width.  The "best" format replicates the 
SAS format of the same name.  See section below for further information.}
}

\code{fapply} will also accept a formatting list, which can contain any 
number of formats from the above list.  To create a formatting list, 
see the \code{\link{flist}} function.
}

\section{"best" Format}{

The SAS "best" format is used to fit numeric values within a certain width.
The word "best" is followed by the desired width, i.e. "best6" or "best12".
The format will then use the most optimal display for the available 
width. 

The format will use the entire value if the number of digits fits in the
desired width.  If not, the format may round the value.  The format may
also use scientific notation if the value is very large or very small.  If
the format cannot fit the value in the desired width at all, it will
emit stars ("*") in the desired width.

For input values that are less than the desired width, the result will be 
left-padded with spaces.  The output value will then always contain the exact
number of characters requested.

Such a format has no direct equivalent in R, and is indeed difficult to
replicate.  For this reason, the \strong{fmtr} package added this format
option for those situations when you want to replicate SAS "best" formatting
as closely as possible.

The "best" format accepts widths between 1 and 32. The default width is 12.
The R "best" format syntax does not accept a number of decimals, as in 
"bestW.d".

Note that "best" widths between 8 and 16 will match SAS most reliably.
Small widths have many special cases, and the logic is difficult to replicate.
For large values, there are some differences between SAS and R in how they
represent these numbers, and sometimes they will not match.
}

\section{"DATEw." Format}{

The SAS "DATEw." format is used to display date values in a readable
character form, such as "01JAN70" or "01-JAN-1970", depending on the
specified width. The word "date" is followed by the desired w(width),
e.g. "date7" or "date9".

The format converts numeric or Date values into character strings using
a pattern that depends on the width. Smaller widths display shorter forms,
while larger widths display more detail. For example:

\itemize{
  \item \strong{date5} -- Displays as \code{mmmyy} (e.g., "JAN70")
  \item \strong{date7} -- Displays as \code{ddmmmyy} (e.g., "01JAN70")
  \item \strong{date9} -- Displays as \code{ddmmmyyyy} (e.g., "01JAN1970")
  \item \strong{date11} -- Displays as \code{dd-mmm-yyyy} (e.g., "01-JAN-1970")
}

The "date" format accepts widths between 5 and 11. Widths outside this
range are not valid and will result in an error. The default width is 7.
Both \code{"datew"} and \code{"datew."} are accepted, the trailing period
is optional and does not affect behavior.

For input values that are numeric, the function will interpret them as
the number of days since 1970-01-01, consistent with R's internal date
representation (different from SAS, which uses 1960-01-01). If the input
is already an R \code{Date} or \code{POSIXt} object, it will be used directly. 
Missing or invalid inputs will result in blank output of the specified width.

The output value is left-padded with spaces if it is shorter than the
requested width, ensuring the formatted result always occupies exactly the
specified number of characters. For example, for the date 1970-01-01,
the result of \code{date7} is \code{"01JAN70"}, while the result of
\code{date8} is \code{" 01JAN70"}, with one additional leading space.

This format has no direct equivalent in base R, so the \strong{fmtr} package
adds this capability for users who wish to replicate SAS-style "date"
formatting behavior as closely as possible, adapted to R's date origin
and conventions.

# Apply string format.
